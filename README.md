# Introduction
Gaussian Radial Basis Function approximator is a parametric approximator for smooth functions. It is especially useful when one needs to approximate smooth function from noisy observations.

For input ![](figures/eq_no_01.png?raw=true), the approximation is given by

![](figures/eq_no_02.png?raw=true)

where ![](figures/eq_no_03.png?raw=true) is the number of radial basis centroids ![](figures/eq_no_04.png?raw=true), ![](figures/eq_no_05.png?raw=true) are the weights, ![](figures/eq_no_06.png?raw=true) is the basis function and the norm is usually taken to be the Euclidean distance.

The centroids ![](figures/eq_no_07.png?raw=true) are equally spaced points in the input space where the basis functions are centered.

While other basis functions can be used, the Gaussian density is a popular choice for continuous function approximation. The Gaussian density is given by

![](figures/eq_no_08.png?raw=true) 

where ![](figures/eq_no_09.png?raw=true) is a scaling factor. While this basis function is nonlinear, the approximator is linear in the weights ![](figures/eq_no_10.png?raw=true) and so the solution can be approximated with linear least-squares.

# Installation
`cpp-rbf` is a header-only library and uses some c++11 features.

## Dependencies
* [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) for linear algebra.

For plotting the example plots, you also need

* Python + numpy + [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Compilation
To run the example [examples/testrbf.cpp](examples/testrbf.cpp) that approximates 2d and 3d sin(),

1. Edit the [makefile](Makefile) to include the location of Armadillo headers and library.
2. Run `make` in the project root directory.
